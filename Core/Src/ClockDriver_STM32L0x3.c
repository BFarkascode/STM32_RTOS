	/**
	 * What happens here?
	 * Firstly, we choose a clocking input, which is going to be HSI16 for us (and internal resonator).
	 * Then we set the power interface's clocking and the FLASH NVM clocking, just in case they were not set before (we assume they haven't been). We touch upon the NVM in the NVMDriver project.
	 * Both the NVM and the PWR are set as the standard recommended values. They can be both played with to optimise the power consumption of the mcu, albeit that will be for another project.
	 * We set the AHB, APB1 and APB2 clocks. These are various periphery clocks that will define at what clocking the peripheries will, well, clock.
	 * Knowing what values are set in the AHB/APB1/APB2 is extremely important to have the right clocking on the peripheries (failing to do so will not allow the periphery to work).
	 * Lastly, we set the phased-locked loop or PLL, which allows us to have a base clock of 32 MHz - the maximum for the L0x3 series. In the end, this will be our system clock that will feed the AHB/APB1/APB2
	 *
	 *
	 *
	 * 1)Enable - future - system clock and wait until it becomes available. Originally we are running on MSI.
	 * 2)Set PWREN clock and the VOLTAGE REGULATOR
	 * 3)FLASH prefetch and LATENCY
	 * 4)Set PRESCALER HCLK, PCLK1, PCLK2
	 * 5)Configure PLL
	 * 6)Enable PLL and wait until available
	 * 7)Select clock source for system and wait until available

//2) TIM6 setup for precise delay generation
void TIM6Config (void) {
	/**
	 * What happens here?
	 * We first enable the timer, paying VERY close attention on which APB it is connected to (APB1).
	 * We then prescale the (automatically x2 multiplied!) APB clock to have a nice round frequency.
	 * Since we will play with how far this timer counts, we put the automatic maximum value of count value to maximum. This means that this timer can only count 65535 cycles.
	 * We tgeb enable the timers and wait until it is engaged.
	 *
	 * TIM6 is a basic clock that is configured to provide a counter for a simple delay function (see below).
	 * It is connected to AP1B which is clocking at 16 MHz currently (see above the clock config for the PLL setup to generate 32 MHz and then the APB1 clock divider left at DIV4 and a PCLK multiplier of 2 - not possible to change)
	 * 1)Enable TIM6 clocking
	 * 2)Set prescaler and ARR
	 * 3)Enable timer and wait for update flag

																				//update the timer if we are overflown/underflow with the counter was reinitialised.
																				//This part is necessary since we can update on the fly. We just need to wait until we are done with a counting cycle and thus an update event has been generated.
																				//also, almost everything is preloaded before it takes effect
																				//update events can be disabled by writing to the UDIS bits in CR1. UDIS as LOW is UDIS ENABLED!!!s
